What does this project do?
This project is a clicker game that teaches people how to manage there natural 
resources for a better future. People will click a button that will cause them to
get certain resources. People can buy things with the resources to get more resources.
In this game we have 2 resources energy and polution. Energy is the resource that 
can buy things. Polution is a percentage bar that is it reaches 0% you win as 
there is no more polution in the world but if the planet has 100% pollution, the
planet dies out and you lose.

How did we build it?
In the HTML/CSS we divided the screen in 3 parts, the left most part is the planet
which will be clicked gives energy and adds or subtracts polution. On the right 
it shows things purchased and things you can buy.

What are the challenges in this project?
One of the big challenges we ran into is the lack of time. This is because with more
time we could discuss problems easier and make things look more profesional.

What did we learn?
We learned how to seperate code through a team. This made things easier and cohesive
in the group. Also we learned new things like putting functions in functions, we
objects, and flex boxes.

What is next for our project?
We plan to add more purchasable things in the game. Also one plan would be upgrades
that make your solar pannels or coal factories better in some way.
